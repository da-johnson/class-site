        <h1 style="text-align:center;">The Future of Low-Earth Orbit</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; display: inline-block">Retirement of the International Space Station</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; display: inline-block">Space stations play a vital role in researching efforts for manufacturing in space and general research. With the planned retirement of the International Space Station (ISS) in 2031, its contributions will be sorely missed. However, commercial interest in space is increasing, with new space stations being developed by various companies. NASA has signed agreements with Axiom, Blue Origin, Nanoracks LLC, and Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation to develop designs for space stations and other commercial destinations in space. The total estimated award amount for all four funded Space Act Agreements is $415.6 million. These agreements will enable a robust, American-led commercial economy in low-Earth orbit, maintaining an uninterrupted U.S. presence in space.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 5%;">More information on each commercial space station can be found in the sections below, along with an image that links to each project's home site.</p>

        <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 10%;">
          <div class="column" style="width: 45%; padding: 5px;"><h3>Axiom</h3><p>As the construction of the Axiom Space Station progresses, with a targeted launch date in late 2025, this next-generation platform in low-Earth orbit promises to open new frontiers in various research fields. One area of particular interest is pharmaceutical research, where microgravity offers unique opportunities to study biological processes and develop novel drugs.</p>
            <p>In microgravity, muscle and bone tissues experience accelerated atrophy, making space an ideal environment for testing drugs that prevent or reverse tissue loss. Research performed in microgravity has already contributed to the FDA approval and marketing of several drugs, highlighting the potential of this environment to drive biomedical advancements.</p>
            <p>Myostatin, a muscle secreted factor that negatively regulates muscle cell growth, is one focus of pharmaceutical research on the space station. Mighty mice, genetically engineered to have disrupted myostatin function, maintain their preflight muscle mass in space. This discovery has led to the development of antibody-based drugs targeting myostatin, which are currently in various stages of clinical trials.</p>
            <p>Another promising drug under development is the Activin type IIB receptor decoy (ACVR2B/Fc). This novel antibody-based drug promotes growth and homeostasis of both muscle and bone. In microgravity, treatment with the ACVR2B/Fc drug has shown dramatic increases in muscle and bone mass, protecting these tissues against atrophy. Moreover, the drug has demonstrated the ability to reverse atrophied bone and muscle, offering hope for future treatments addressing aging, injury, disuse, or disease-induced atrophy.</p>
            <p>Aside from pharmaceutical research, the Axiom Space Station will host a variety of other research areas, including protein crystallization, regenerative medicine, stem cells, organoids, spheroids, 3D bioprinting, and materials science. As the construction of this innovative platform continues, the potential for scientific breakthroughs in microgravity is becoming increasingly apparent.</p></div>
