  <p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; display: inline-block">As the possibility of interplanetary voyages begins to appear on the horizon and dreams of colonizing Mars with it, it is crucial to explore the role biotechnology will play in these endeavors. We are four students at Caltech carrying out an analysis of technology necessary to support these missions from a biological perspective. The focus of our research is on the use of biotech to achieve nutrition supplementation  in space, the production of time-critical pharmaceuticals, and the development of biomaterials such as polymers, biocement, and novel materials that enhance our capabilities in transit and development on Mars. These technologies are supported by advances in synthetic biology as well as by tried and tested methods set aside due to the low cost of abundant fossil fuels. We are inspired by both the portability, and broad utility of biology, and believe that as such technologies mature, they will find use on Earth as well. By focusing on C1 carbons as reagents , we hope to develop a sustainable system that benefits both Earth and space exploration. We are excited to share the results of our research and invites readers to reach out with any questions or suggestions.</p>

            As we explore the possibilities of interplanetary travel and colonization, we must face the challenges and limitations that come with it. Being far from any kind of support and dealing with radiation and carefully planning nutrition to maintain health in an inhospitable environment are just a few of the obstacles we will face. To overcome these challenges, we need to explore every avenue to maximize efficiency and sustainability, and biotechnology holds great potential in this regard.

            One area where biotechnology can be especially useful is in recycling materials in space, including atmospheric elements. Through carbon dioxide scrubbers and oxygen generators, we can recycle and reuse breathable air. However, retaining carbon dioxide is especially important for the manufacturing of food, drugs, and polymers. But what happens to the carbon when it is scrubbed? Here, biology comes to the rescue: algae, as it grows, can use carbon dioxide to produce oxygen, organic matter, and other useful compounds. Algae could be used to recycle carbon dioxide, turning it into valuable biomass that can be used as a source of food and oxygen for the crew, or even as a feedstock for biomanufacturing.

            Another exciting area for biotechnology in space is the use of regolith, the soil and rocks found on the surface of Mars. Regolith can be used to create building materials, ceramics, and even printed circuit boards. It also contains a wealth of minerals, including iron, magnesium, and aluminum, which can be used to produce metals and alloys. But there is a catch: regolith is full of toxic chemicals and heavy metals that could harm human health. To make it usable, biotechnology could be used to detoxify the regolith. For example, some microbes can use toxic metals as a source of energy, effectively neutralizing them. Using such microbes could turn a hazardous waste into a valuable resource.

            When it comes to traveling to Mars, the crew will need to bring along everything necessary for the journey, including breathable air, food, and water. Biodegradable plastic components could be used, which can later be recycled by bioreactors on Mars. Waste water can also be processed and reused once the colony is established. But what about food? Growing crops in space is challenging, but biotechnology offers some solutions. For example, researchers are developing genetically engineered crops that are more resistant to radiation, pests, and environmental stresses. Some crops can even be grown without soil, using hydroponic or aeroponic systems. But we can also look to nature for inspiration: extremophiles, organisms that can survive in the harshest environments on Earth, may hold the key to growing crops on Mars.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, biotechnology holds great promise for interplanetary travel and Mars colonization. By recycling materials, including atmospheric elements and regolith, we can create a sustainable environment. By using biology to detoxify regolith, recycle carbon dioxide, and grow crops, we can turn hazardous waste into valuable resources. By bringing along necessary supplies and recycling as much as possible, we can reduce waste and increase efficiency. As we continue to explore the possibilities of biotechnology in space, we may discover new ways to create a sustainable environment both on Earth and beyond.
